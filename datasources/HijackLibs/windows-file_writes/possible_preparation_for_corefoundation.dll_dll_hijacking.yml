    selection:
        TargetFileName: '*\corefoundation.dll'
    filter:
        TargetFileName:
            - 'c:\program files\Common Files\Apple\Apple Application Support\*'
            - 'c:\program files (x86)\Common Files\Apple\Apple Application Support\*'

            - 'c:\$windows.~bt\*'
            - 'c:\windows\softwaredistribution\*'

    condition: selection and not filter
falsepositives:
    - False positives are likely. This rule is more suitable for hunting than for generating detections.
