detection:
    selection:
        TargetFileName: '*\jli.dll'
    filter:
        TargetFileName:
            - 'c:\program files\Java\*\bin\*'
            - 'c:\program files (x86)\Java\*\bin\*'
            - 'c:\program files\*\jre\bin\*'
            - 'c:\program files (x86)\*\jre\bin\*'
            - 'c:\users\*\appdata\local\Temp\*\bin\*'

    condition: selection and not filter
falsepositives:
    - False positives are likely. This rule is more suitable for hunting than for generating detections.
