    selection:
        TargetFileName: '*\flutter_gpu_texture_renderer_plugin.dll'
    filter:
        TargetFileName:
            - 'c:\users\*\appdata\local\rustdesk\*'
            - 'c:\program files\RustDesk\*'
            - 'c:\program files (x86)\RustDesk\*'

    condition: selection and not filter
falsepositives:
    - False positives are likely. This rule is more suitable for hunting than for generating detections.
