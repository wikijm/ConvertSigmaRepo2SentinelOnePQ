title: Suspicious Download and Execute Pattern via Curl/Wget
id: a2d9e2f3-0f43-4c7a-bcd9-9acfc0d723aa
status: experimental
description: |
    Detects suspicious use of command-line tools such as curl or wget to download remote
    content - particularly scripts - into temporary directories (e.g., /dev/shm, /tmp), followed by
    immediate execution, indicating potential malicious activity. This pattern is commonly used
    by malicious scripts, stagers, or downloaders in fileless or multi-stage Linux attacks.
