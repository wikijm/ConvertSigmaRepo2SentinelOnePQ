status: test
description: |
    Detects potentially suspicious child processes of Wscript/Cscript. These include processes such as rundll32 with uncommon exports or PowerShell spawning rundll32 or regsvr32.
    Malware such as Pikabot and Qakbot were seen using similar techniques as well as many others.
